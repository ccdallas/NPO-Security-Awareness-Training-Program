## What is security awareness training?
<p>Information security awareness training is an organizational program whose goal is to empower employees to protect the company’s data through mindful security engagement. This includes understanding internet use, remote access, and other compliance policies that can put the network at risk of cyber attacks. While human error is the weakest link when it comes to causing data breaches, it also offers the greatest opportunity for strengthening the company’s first line of defense.</p>

## Why employees need security awareness training
<p>The number of devices used for personal and business communication can blur the lines of security and cause regular lapses in protocol. Additionally, the growth of remote work requires special social engineering training that addresses the need for fortifying home networks.

Back in the old days, security awareness training was a half-day PowerPoint presentation with a certificate of completion at the end. Unfortunately, that didn’t cut it then, and it’s far less effective now. Training now has to successfully take employees through the four stages of competence:

1. Unconscious incompetence: This is a level of profound unawareness where employees don’t know what they don’t know. As a result, their behavior is far more careless than desirable.<br>
2. Conscious incompetence: Employees know that they don’t know something and realize they lack the tools needed to bridge the gap. This is the stage employees were sometimes left at even after they went through old-school training.<br>
3. Conscious competence: With access to information, employees consciously weigh their options to come to good conclusions.<br>
4. Unconscious competence: Pattern-based behavior creates the kind of muscle memory that lets employees know something so well they don’t have to think about it.<br>

Level 4, unconscious competence, is the ultimate goal of security awareness training for employees. Reaching this diminishes the likelihood of human error, leading to better protection.</p>
