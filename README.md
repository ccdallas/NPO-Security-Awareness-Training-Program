## What is security awareness training?

<p>As a non-profit organization, you might think that you're not a target for cyber attacks. However, the truth is that cybercriminals are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities they can exploit, and unfortunately, non-profit organizations are not immune.

The first step to cyber security awareness is to recognize the potential risks. This includes keeping an eye out for suspicious emails, links, or attachments, and password-protecting sensitive data. Additionally, it's important to keep all software up to date with the latest security patches to prevent cyber criminals from exploiting known vulnerabilities.

Another important aspect of cyber security awareness is educating your staff on best practices for staying safe online. This includes training on how to recognize and avoid phishing scams, how to create strong passwords, and how to use two-factor authentication for added security.

Remember, cyber security awareness is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process. By staying vigilant and proactive in your efforts to protect your organization's data, you can significantly reduce the risk of a cyber attack. Stay safe, lovely non-profit organizations!.</p>

## Why employees need security awareness training
<p>The number of devices used for personal and business communication can blur the lines of security and cause regular lapses in protocol. Additionally, the growth of remote work requires special social engineering training that addresses the need for fortifying home networks.

Back in the old days, security awareness training was a half-day PowerPoint presentation with a certificate of completion at the end. Unfortunately, that didn’t cut it then, and it’s far less effective now. Training now has to take employees through the four stages of competence successfully:

1. Unconscious incompetence: This is a level of profound unawareness where employees don’t know what they don’t know. As a result, their behavior is far more careless than desirable.<br>
2. Conscious incompetence: Employees know that they don’t know something and realize they lack the tools needed to bridge the gap. This is the stage employees were sometimes left at even after they went through old-school training.<br>
3. Conscious competence: With access to information, employees consciously weigh their options to come to good conclusions.<br>
4. Unconscious competence: Pattern-based behavior creates the kind of muscle memory that lets employees know something so well they don’t have to think about it.<br>

Unconscious competence is the ultimate goal of security awareness training for employees. Reaching this diminishes the likelihood of human error, leading to better protection.</p>

## 7 ways security awareness can make or break your 2023

### Step 1: Identify Your Organization's Digital Assets
Identify your organization's digital assets, including sensitive information like financial records, donor details, and employee records. This step is crucial to assess the level of security needed to protect these assets.

### Step 2: Educate Your Employees on Cybersecurity Best Practices
Educate your employees on cybersecurity best practices. This includes promoting the use of strong passwords, educating them about phishing scams, and emphasizing the importance of keeping software up-to-date. Encourage a culture of security within your organization.

### Step 3: Use Security Software to Protect Your Organization's Digital Assets
Implement security software to safeguard your organization's digital assets. This may include antivirus software, firewalls, and encryption tools. Regularly update these tools to ensure they provide up-to-date protection.

### Step 4: Conduct Regular Security Audits
Regularly conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities in your organization's security system. You can perform these audits internally or hire a third-party auditor. The goal is to identify potential weaknesses before they are exploited by cybercriminals.

### Step 5: Develop an Incident Response Plan
Create a well-defined incident response plan for your organization. This plan should outline how to react to different types of cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches or cyberattacks. Ensure that your employees are familiar with the plan and know their roles in responding to security incidents.

### Step 6: Provide Ongoing Training and Awareness
Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field. Continuously provide training and awareness programs to keep your employees up to date with the latest threats and best practices. This ongoing education ensures that your organization remains vigilant and adaptable in the face of evolving cyber risks.

### Step 7: Monitor and Update Security Measures
Regularly monitor and update your security measures. This includes assessing the effectiveness of your security software, reviewing access controls, and analyzing logs for unusual activities. Adjust your security strategies as necessary to stay ahead of emerging threats.
